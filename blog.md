# Introduction
*Srsly* aims to introduce a way to make contributions to the Ethereum KZG ceremony through mobile devices. While several current clients exist, none of them allow the ability to contribute to the ceremony using a phone. Our app was developed in Swift, and our contribution was performed via the iOS simulator to demonstrate that in future ceremonies, we can contribute using mobile devices.

# Process
The app starts with authentication either using Github or an Ethereum wallet. Then, the sequencer is queried, and the app waits until a slot is obtained. When the slot finally is obtained, using the transcript and BLS operations leading to scalar multiplication, we produce a new transcript and send it back to the sequencer.

We went through several challenges in the process of creating the app. The main challenge involved writing elliptic curve operations from scratch in Swift. Because there was no existing library that already did BLS operations, we had to learn and implement the functionality for it, starting from field elements and working our way up to scalar multiplication in BLS12-381. 

Our next challenge was the fact that our scalar multiplication was *way too slow* for the contribution to be done in a reasonable amount of time. We took our inspiration from the lattice-based scalar multiplication used by the go-client and implemented our own in Swift to speed the process up. While computing our contribution still took more than the allotted time, especially given the computation limitations of a mobile device, future iterations of our app could involve further parallelization among the powers of tau and other operations. However, parallelization is limited to future iOS versions, so this would be something to consider.

# Entropy/Deletion
We generate entropy using the `SecRandomCopyBytes` built-in Swift function with a length of 255 bits–one is generated for each power of tau. These are the values used to perform the scalar multiplication of the transcript. We then delete these in lines [1267-1270](https://github.com/vishady721/swift-kzg-ios-client/blob/f887690e80c6e9339db043c9c8397801f7c5dde5/srsly/srsly/ViewController.swift#L1267) of [ViewController.swift](./srsly/srsly/ViewController.swift) by setting each number value back to 0.

# Next 
We have several more steps and visions for the continuation of this project! The first is abstracting all of the BLS operations we programmed into its own importable package. This way, elliptic curve operations on BLS12-381 can be done in Swift apps by importing this package. On that note, adding a pairing check in this library would help in introducing a transcript verification component of the app–although given the processing limitations of a mobile device, it is unclear whether this could be computed in a reasonable amount of time given its complexity. 

We also hope to add to the entropy by XOR-ing each of the numbers generated by `SecRandomCopyBytes` with some kind of moving average on the accelerometer data generated by the iPhone before the contribution starts as a one-time pad. This adds to the entropy while using a property unique to mobile devices! Finally, we can continue to speed up the operations done in this contribution using parallelization, as mentioned earlier. By introducing some kind of mechanism for users to be able to turn their phones off as the contribution is taking place, and speeding up the process, the app will be even more user-friendly than it currently is.
